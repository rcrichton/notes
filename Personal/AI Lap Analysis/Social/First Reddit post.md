Title: Looking for suggestions and feedback: AI Race Engineer

Hi all, I'm currently working on a product that I think could be really cool. It's a lap data analysis system integrated with AI that will allow you to get feedback on how you are doing and where you can improve.

I'm looking to see if there is any interest for this sort of thing and if anyone has any suggestions or feedback for me.

I'm trying to merge my two passions: cars and track days, and coding :)

If you are interested, take a look and let me know your thoughts. I have a basic landing page here: https://www.perfect-apex.com/

After AI refinement:

**Title:** Passion Project Idea: AI Race Engineer for Track Days - Thoughts & Feedback Welcome

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I'm passionate about cars and love spending time out on the track. I'm also a coder by trade, and I've been thinking about how to combine these two interests.

I've started tinkering with an idea for an AI-powered tool that analyzes lap data (from GPS loggers, etc.). The goal would be to provide personalized feedback on your driving â€“ identifying where you're losing time, potential areas for improvement, almost like having a virtual race engineer helping you understand your laps better.

Before I dive too deep, I wanted to check in with this community. Is this something you could see yourself using? Does the idea of AI-driven feedback on your track performance resonate?

I'm really just trying to see if this solves a real problem or fills a gap for fellow enthusiasts. Any feedback, suggestions, or even criticisms are incredibly welcome at this early stage.

I threw together a basic landing page to outline the concept a bit more: [https://www.perfect-apex.com/](https://www.perfect-apex.com/ "null")

Appreciate any thoughts you're willing to share! Thanks for reading.

# Summary of feedback
Okay, let's break down the feedback from your Reddit post on the AI Race Engineer concept (Perfect Apex).

**Summary of General Feedback & Concerns:**

1.  **Strong Comparison to Existing Products:** The most frequent comment is the comparison to **Garmin Catalyst**. Many users see your idea as very similar, questioning its novelty and unique value proposition. Some also mentioned **Vbox** and sim racing tools like **Trophi.ai**.
2.  **Skepticism about Technical Feasibility & Data Limitations:** There's significant doubt about whether truly *meaningful* and *actionable* insights (e.g., specific braking point changes, precise line adjustments) can be generated solely from typical track day data (GPS, accelerometer). Commenters highlighted the lack of crucial inputs like throttle, brake pressure, steering angle, precise track maps, and high-quality benchmark laps (like those available in sims).
3.  **Value Proposition Questions:** While the *idea* is intriguing to some, there's concern about whether basic data analysis alone provides enough value for users (especially experienced ones like instructors) *to pay for it*. The "democratization" aspect (using existing loggers) is appreciated, but the core analysis needs to be demonstrably useful.
4.  **Desire for Advanced Features (Beyond Basic Analysis):**
    *   **Video Integration:** Several users strongly suggested integrating video analysis, specifically visualizing the suggested changes overlaid on the user's footage. This was seen as a high-value feature.
    *   **Lap Comparison:** The ability to compare a user's lap against a faster reference lap (their own best, another user's, or an 'ideal' lap) was a popular request, often framed as wanting a "ghost lap" feature.
5.  **Importance of Accuracy & Expert Input:** Users emphasized that any AI suggestions *must* be accurate, citing experiences with inaccurate AI feedback elsewhere. Involving driving coaches in development was recommended to ensure the advice is sound ("garbage in, garbage out").
6.  **Retrospective vs. Live Feedback:** Your focus on retrospective analysis was questioned by some who felt live feedback (like Catalyst offers) is more immediately useful. You need to clearly articulate the benefits of the post-session, chatbot-driven approach.
7.  **Sim Racing Parallels & Challenges:** The comparison to sim racing tools highlights both potential (what *could* be done) and challenges (lack of clean, comprehensive data and controlled environments in the real world).

**Actionable Insights for Product Improvement:**

1.  **Refine & Clearly Articulate Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
    *   **Action:** Explicitly differentiate Perfect Apex from Garmin Catalyst. Emphasize the benefits of:
        *   **Retrospective Analysis:** Allowing deeper dives, thoughtful review, and preparation for the *next* session.
        *   **Hardware Agnosticism:** Leveraging data users *already* collect with various loggers (TrackAddict, RaceChrono, etc.), lowering the barrier to entry.
        *   **Conversational AI Interface:** Highlight how this allows for more tailored Q&A and exploration of data compared to static reports.
    *   **Action:** Update your landing page and future communications to address these differentiators head-on.

2.  **Prioritize Proving Core AI Capability & Manage Expectations:**
    *   **Action:** Focus R&D on demonstrating that your AI *can* extract genuinely useful, specific insights from limited GPS/accelerometer data. Start with achievable goals (e.g., identifying biggest time-loss sections, comparing consistency between laps, analyzing speed traces through corners) before tackling highly complex advice (e.g., "brake 5m later").
    *   **Action:** Be transparent about the limitations imposed by the data. Don't over-promise what the AI can do initially. Set realistic expectations.
    *   **Action:** Experiment with data preprocessing techniques (map matching, segmenting laps, etc.) to provide more context to the AI. Consider how to incorporate user input (car type, track conditions) to refine analysis.

3.  **Develop a Phased Feature Roadmap Based on Value & Feasibility:**
    *   **Action:** Keep the core data analysis + chatbot interface as the MVP.
    *   **Action:** Place "Lap Comparison" (vs. user's own best lap initially) high on the roadmap, as it directly addresses a user need and is likely more feasible than comparing to external benchmarks immediately.
    *   **Action:** Add "Video Overlay / Analysis" as a key future enhancement, potentially as a premium feature, given the high interest but also high complexity.
    *   **Action:** Consider incorporating educational content (tutorials on interpreting data) as a value-add.

4.  **Validate AI Output Rigorously:**
    *   **Action:** Seek input and validation from experienced drivers and driving coaches during development. Ensure the AI's suggestions align with sound driving principles.
    *   **Action:** Implement internal checks and balances for the AI's suggestions. Allow users to flag potentially incorrect advice.

5.  **Explore Technical Strategies:**
    *   **Action:** Investigate leveraging and fine-tuning existing Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically trained on driving data analysis, as suggested by one user.
    *   **Action:** Explore partnerships (as suggested regarding Trophi.ai) if building the entire analysis engine from scratch proves too difficult, though focus on your USP first.

6.  **Engage with the Community:**
    *   **Action:** Continue sharing progress (even small experimental wins) and actively solicit feedback. Address the skepticism directly by showing, not just telling, what your tool can do as it develops. Build a small beta group with users who provided constructive feedback.

By addressing the comparisons head-on, proving the core technical value (even if starting simple), and roadmap ping highly requested features like video and lap comparison, you can build a stronger case for Perfect Apex. The key is demonstrating tangible value beyond what users feel they already get from existing tools or manual analysis. Good luck!
