Title: Work in progress: Open Motorsports Data Platform (Update post)
Hi all,

Thanks for all your feedback on my [previous post about my AI Race Engineer idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1jvwnbt/passion_project_idea_ai_race_engineer_for_track/). Since then I've thought hard about the direction to take. I've decided to lean less into the AI angle and more into open collaboration and community building. I hope that is more exciting to everyone. 

My new idea is to create a platform for visualizing, sharing and discussing motorsports telemetry. The hope is to support as many data formats as possible so not matter what equipment or apps you and your friends use, you can still openly share and discuss your data.

Currently I've implemented a dashboard for session analysis that has some basic visualizations as well as a chat panel where you can comment on the session while @-tagging particular points in the lap. You may also use the dedicated AI Chat to ask questions if you want an in-depth analysis.

I've implemented a sharing system that allows you to share sessions via a link or to make them public which will allow these session to be discoverable in the future (discoverability is not yet implemented).

I have a demo shared session up and running and I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to make this better. What features would you love to see? Please give it a go and let me know your thoughts.

My plan is to provide as much of the basics to everyone for free but charge for those that need storage for lots of session data or want to access advanced features.

Here are some of the idea I've had for future versions:

- Compare laps between users so you and your friends can compare notes
- Add a mini sectors visualisation
- Embed Youtube videos into the dashboard and link to telemetry (I'm not sure it would be wise for me to host the videos myself due to storage/streaming costs)
- Add leaderboards for tracks
- Make session discoverable, perhaps searching by track or by car

The next step will probably be some sort of closed beta test. Please sign up to the waitlist so I may get in contact with if you are interested to try this early. See: https://www.perfect-apex.com/

Thanks for taking a look. All comments and suggestions are welcome!

# AI feedback on post

Okay, this is a great update and a smart pivot based on the initial feedback! You're directly addressing some of the core concerns (especially around the feasibility of standalone AI and the desire for more community/data sharing aspects).

Here's a review of your planned second post, with suggestions to make it even more humble, genuine, exciting, and compelling, while clearly showing you've listened:

**Overall Strengths of Your Draft:**

*   **Clear Acknowledgment:** You directly link to and thank users for the previous feedback.
*   **Explains the Pivot:** You clearly state the shift in direction.
*   **Focus on Community/Openness:** This resonates well with general online communities and addresses a different angle than a pure AI tool.
*   **Demo Link:** Essential! Showing is always better than telling.
*   **Specific Features Listed:** Gives people concrete things to react to.
*   **Future Roadmap:** Shows forward thinking.
*   **Call to Action:** Clear waitlist sign-up.
*   **Monetization Transparency:** Good to mention early.

**Proposed Revised Reddit Post:**

**Title Option 1 (Direct & Clear):** Update on my AI Race Engineer: Pivoting to an Open Motorsports Data Platform - Feedback Appreciated!
**Title Option 2 (Benefit-Oriented):** Heard Your Feedback! Shifting Focus to an Open Platform for Sharing & Analyzing Track Data – What Do You Think?
**Title Option 3 (Intriguing):** From AI Race Engineer to Community Data Hub: An Update & A New Demo for Your Track Day Telemetry

*(I lean towards Option 1 or 2 for clarity, but 3 is also good. Let's use Option 1 for this example.)*

**Title:** Update on my AI Race Engineer: Pivoting to an Open Motorsports Data Platform - Feedback Appreciated!

**Body:**

Hi everyone,

First off, a massive thank you for all the great feedback on my [previous post about the AI Race Engineer idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1jvwnbt/passion_project_idea_ai_race_engineer_for_track/). Your comments about existing tools, difficulties focusing on AI only, and the desire for more collaborative features were very helpful.

I've spent a lot of time reflcting on that feedback, and it's helped guide a shift in direction. While AI is still part of the vision, I'm now leaning much more into building an open platform for visualizing, sharing, and discussing motorsport telemetry. The goal is to create a space where the community can easily bring their data together, regardless of the logger they use.

**What's the New Vision?**

Imagine a platform where:

* You can upload data from various loggers (TrackAddict, RaceChrono, MoTeC, VBox, etc. – aiming for broad support!).
* You can easily share specific sessions with friends, coaches, or the wider comunity via a simple link.
* You can have discussions right on the data, tagging specific points in a lap to ask questions or point things out.

**What I've Built So Far (Looking for Your Thoughts!):**

I've been working on an initial version and would be thrilled if you could take a look and share your honest feedback.

* **Current Features:**
   * A dashboard for session analysis with some initial visualizations.
   * A session chat panel where you can comment on the session, '@-tagging' specific moments in a lap.
   * A sharing system (share via link, or make sessions public for future discovery – discovery not yet built).
   * An "AI Chat" feature: A tool to help you ask in-depth questions about your data, assisting your own analysis.

**Please check out this live demo session:** [https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/cfbf2566-bd1e-41cc-87e2-b59ab20c83b0](https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/cfbf2566-bd1e-41cc-87e2-b59ab20c83b0)

This data come from a session I recorded via TrackAddict on a previous track day. I'd love to hear:

* What do you like?
* What's confusing or could be improved?
* What features would make this genuinely useful for you?

**Future Ideas (Help Me Prioritize!):**

Based on initial thoughts and some of your previous feedback, here's what I'm considering:

* **Lap Comparison:** Easily compare laps between different users (or your own laps).
* **Mini-Sector Analysis:** Break down laps into smaller, comparable segments. Display a cool color-coded visualization.
* **Video Integration:** Embed YouTube videos and sync them with telemetry (hosting videos directly is likely too costly, but linking/syncing seems feasible).
* **Track Leaderboards:** Community-driven leaderboards (with appropriate privacy/sharing controls).
* **Enhanced Session Discovery:** Search for public sessions by track, car, etc.

**Monetization & Next Steps:**

My aim is to offer a generous free tier for core visualization, sharing, and discussion. I want everyone to be able to benefit from this. For users needing more storage for many sessions or access to more advanced analysis features, there will likely be a subscription model to help sustain and grow the platform into something awesome!

The immediate next step is to gather more feedback and then likely move towards a closed beta. If you're interested in being an early tester and helping shape Perfect Apex, please sign up here: [https://www.perfect-apex.com/](https://www.perfect-apex.com/)

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and for considering my evolved idea. Your honest opinions, critiques, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

**Key Changes and Why:**

1.  **Title:** More explicit about the update and pivot, while still inviting feedback.
2.  **Opening:** Stronger emphasis on *how* the previous feedback was used. This shows you genuinely listened. "Invaluable," "helped guide a shift."
3.  **"What's the New Vision?" Section:** Clearly articulates the core benefits of the new direction in a more engaging way before diving into features. Highlighting "various loggers" and "discussions *right on the data*" directly addresses some of the previous desires for hardware agnosticism and collaborative analysis.
4.  **Re-framing AI:** The explanation for "AI Chat" is crucial. You've downplayed the "magic AI race engineer" and reframed it as an analytical assistant for the *user*. This manages expectations and aligns better with what's likely feasible and useful given the data. It addresses the skepticism from the first post.
5.  **Clearer Ask with Demo:** "Please check out this live demo session" is a direct call to action. The bullet points for what kind of feedback you want are more specific.
6.  **"Help Me Prioritize!" for Future Ideas:** Makes the community feel more involved in the roadmap.
7.  **Monetization Framing:** "To help sustain and grow the platform" sounds better than just "charge for."
8.  **Stronger Call to Action Wording:** "Being an early tester and helping shape Perfect Apex" is more compelling.
9.  **Tone:** The language aims for genuine appreciation and a collaborative spirit. Phrases like "massive thank you," "incredibly insightful," "honest feedback," "thrilled if you could" contribute to this.
10. **Structure:** Using more distinct sections and bullet points makes it easier to read and digest.

This revised version aims to hit all your marks: humble (acknowledging past feedback led to change), genuine (sharing the journey), exciting (focusing on community and open data), and compelling (clear value proposition and call to action). Good luck with the post!

# AI Summary of feedback

**Summary of General Feedback & Concerns:**

1. **Overwhelmingly Positive Reception of the Pivot:** The shift from a pure "AI Race Engineer" to an open, collaborative data platform was met with almost universal praise. Users see it as a much clearer, more valuable, and more unique idea that solves a real problem. Your transparency and willingness to listen were explicitly commended.
    
2. **Strong Desire for Lap Comparison & Overlays:** This was, by far, the most frequently and passionately requested feature. Users don't just want to see numbers; they want to visually overlay their lap trace against a faster one (their own, a friend's, or a coach's) to see exactly where time is lost or gained. This is seen as the "killer feature."
    
3. **Video Synchronization is a High-Value Add:** Alongside lap comparison, the idea of syncing telemetry with a YouTube video was the other major "premium" feature that users got excited about. Many see this combination (video + data overlay) as the ultimate analysis tool and would be willing to pay for it.
    
4. **Data Format Support is Foundational:** A recurring technical question was about the types of data you'll support. Users immediately brought up the need to handle different file formats from popular loggers like **RaceChrono, TrackAddict, and especially AiM**, which is common among more serious drivers. Success here is seen as critical to the "open" promise.
    
5. **Monetization Model is Crucial:** Users are receptive to the "generous free tier, paid for power features" model. The key is that the core functionality (uploading a session, basic analysis, sharing with a friend) needs to be free to get them hooked. Limiting the number of stored sessions in the free tier was seen as a fair approach.
    
6. **Praise for Unique Features:** The demo's existing features were also noticed. The **ability to share a session with a simple link** was praised, and the concept of **@-tagging a specific point in a lap within the chat** was highlighted as a unique and excellent idea for collaborative coaching.
    
7. **Nuance is Needed for Leaderboards:** While people like the idea of leaderboards, they cautioned that they must be implemented with filters (e.g., by car, car class, tires, modifications). Without this, they become "useless" and just a list of the most powerful cars.
    
8. **UI/UX Feedback:** Initial feedback on the demo's UI was generally positive ("looks promising," "clean"), but some users noted it was confusing or difficult to use on mobile, indicating a need for responsive design.
    

**Actionable Insights for Product Improvement:**

1. **Double Down on the "Open Platform" Vision:** You've struck a chord. Continue to emphasize the hardware-agnostic, collaborative, and community-focused aspects in all your messaging. This is your core differentiator.
    
2. **Prioritize the "Killer Features" on Your Roadmap:**
    
    - **Action:** **Make Lap Comparison/Overlay the #1 priority.** This is the feature that will drive initial adoption and excitement. The ability to visually compare braking points, lines, and acceleration traces is non-negotiable for users.
        
    - **Action:** **Place Video Synchronization high on the roadmap** as a key value-add, potentially as the cornerstone of a premium subscription tier.
        
3. **Tackle the Data Ingestion Challenge:**
    
    - **Action:** Focus R&D on building a robust data pipeline that can accept and normalize data from the most requested formats (start with RaceChrono, TrackAddict, and look into AiM). Your ability to deliver on the "no matter what gear you use" promise is essential for credibility.
        
4. **Refine and Solidify the Business Model:**
    
    - **Action:** Define what the "generous free tier" looks like. A great starting point based on feedback would be: unlimited analysis/sharing of a small number of recent sessions (e.g., your last 1-3 track days), with subscriptions required for storing a larger historical archive and accessing premium features (like multi-lap comparison or video sync).
        
5. **Improve and Highlight What's Already Working:**
    
    - **Action:** Address the mobile UI/UX issues to ensure the platform is accessible on all devices.
        
    - **Action:** In future communications, highlight the unique @-tagging chat feature. It's a subtle but powerful differentiator that enhances the collaborative promise.
        
6. **Design Features with User-Requested Nuance:**
    
    - **Action:** When you build leaderboards, plan for a robust filtering system from day one. Engage the community on what filters would be most useful (car, class, track conditions, etc.).
        

You have successfully navigated the feedback process, and the community has rewarded you with a clear, validated roadmap. The current direction is incredibly promising. Keep engaging, keep building, and keep showing them your progress.
