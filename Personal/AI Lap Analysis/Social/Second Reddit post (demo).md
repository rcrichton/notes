Title: Work in progress: Open Motorsports Data Platform (Update post)
Hi all,

Thanks for all your feedback on my [previous post about my AI Race Engineer idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1jvwnbt/passion_project_idea_ai_race_engineer_for_track/). Since then I've thought hard about the direction to take. I've decided to lean less into the AI angle and more into open collaboration and community building. I hope that is more exciting to everyone. 

My new idea is to create a platform for visualizing, sharing and discussing motorsports telemetry. The hope is to support as many data formats as possible so not matter what equipment or apps you and your friends use, you can still openly share and discuss your data.

Currently I've implemented a dashboard for session analysis that has some basic visualizations as well as a chat panel where you can comment on the session while @-tagging particular points in the lap. You may also use the dedicated AI Chat to ask questions if you want an in-depth analysis.

I've implemented a sharing system that allows you to share sessions via a link or to make them public which will allow these session to be discoverable in the future (discoverability is not yet implemented).

I have a demo shared session up and running and I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to make this better. What features would you love to see? Please give it a go and let me know your thoughts.

My plan is to provide as much of the basics to everyone for free but charge for those that need storage for lots of session data or want to access advanced features.

Here are some of the idea I've had for future versions:

- Compare laps between users so you and your friends can compare notes
- Add a mini sectors visualisation
- Embed Youtube videos into the dashboard and link to telemetry (I'm not sure it would be wise for me to host the videos myself due to storage/streaming costs)
- Add leaderboards for tracks
- Make session discoverable, perhaps searching by track or by car

The next step will probably be some sort of closed beta test. Please sign up to the waitlist so I may get in contact with if you are interested to try this early. See: https://www.perfect-apex.com/

Thanks for taking a look. All comments and suggestions are welcome!

# AI feedback on post

Okay, this is a great update and a smart pivot based on the initial feedback! You're directly addressing some of the core concerns (especially around the feasibility of standalone AI and the desire for more community/data sharing aspects).

Here's a review of your planned second post, with suggestions to make it even more humble, genuine, exciting, and compelling, while clearly showing you've listened:

**Overall Strengths of Your Draft:**

*   **Clear Acknowledgment:** You directly link to and thank users for the previous feedback.
*   **Explains the Pivot:** You clearly state the shift in direction.
*   **Focus on Community/Openness:** This resonates well with general online communities and addresses a different angle than a pure AI tool.
*   **Demo Link:** Essential! Showing is always better than telling.
*   **Specific Features Listed:** Gives people concrete things to react to.
*   **Future Roadmap:** Shows forward thinking.
*   **Call to Action:** Clear waitlist sign-up.
*   **Monetization Transparency:** Good to mention early.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

Let's refine it section by section.

**Proposed Revised Reddit Post:**

**Title Option 1 (Direct & Clear):** Update on my AI Race Engineer: Pivoting to an Open Motorsports Data Platform - Feedback Appreciated!
**Title Option 2 (Benefit-Oriented):** Heard Your Feedback! Shifting Focus to an Open Platform for Sharing & Analyzing Track Data – What Do You Think?
**Title Option 3 (Intriguing):** From AI Race Engineer to Community Data Hub: An Update & A New Demo for Your Track Day Telemetry

*(I lean towards Option 1 or 2 for clarity, but 3 is also good. Let's use Option 1 for this example.)*

**Title:** Update on my AI Race Engineer: Pivoting to an Open Motorsports Data Platform - Feedback Appreciated!

**Body:**

Hi everyone,

First off, a massive thank you for all the great feedback on my [previous post about the AI Race Engineer idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1jvwnbt/passion_project_idea_ai_race_engineer_for_track/). Your comments about existing tools, difficulties focusing on AI only, and the desire for more collaborative features were very helpful.

I've spent a lot of time reflcting on that feedback, and it's helped guide a shift in direction. While AI is still part of the vision, I'm now leaning much more into building an open platform for visualizing, sharing, and discussing motorsport telemetry. The goal is to create a space where the community can easily bring their data together, regardless of the logger they use.

**What's the New Vision?**

Imagine a platform where:

* You can upload data from various loggers (TrackAddict, RaceChrono, MoTeC, VBox, etc. – aiming for broad support!).
* You can easily share specific sessions with friends, coaches, or the wider comunity via a simple link.
* You can have discussions right on the data, tagging specific points in a lap to ask questions or point things out.

**What I've Built So Far (Looking for Your Thoughts!):**

I've been working on an initial version and would be thrilled if you could take a look and share your honest feedback.

* **Current Features:**
   * A dashboard for session analysis with some initial visualizations.
   * A session chat panel where you can comment on the session, '@-tagging' specific moments in a lap.
   * A sharing system (share via link, or make sessions public for future discovery – discovery not yet built).
   * An "AI Chat" feature: A tool to help you ask in-depth questions about your data, assisting your own analysis.

**Please check out this live demo session using data from one of my previously recorded sessions:** [https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/cfbf2566-bd1e-41cc-87e2-b59ab20c83b0](https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/cfbf2566-bd1e-41cc-87e2-b59ab20c83b0)

I'd love to hear:

* What do you like?
* What's confusing or could be improved?
* What features would make this genuinely useful for *you*?

**Future Ideas (Help Me Prioritize!):**

Based on initial thoughts and some of your previous feedback, here's what I'm considering:

* **Lap Comparison:** Easily compare laps between different users (or your own laps).
* **Mini-Sector Analysis:** Break down laps into smaller, comparable segments. Display a cool color-coded visualization.
* **Video Integration:** Embed YouTube videos and sync them with telemetry (hosting videos directly is likely too costly, but linking/syncing seems feasible).
* **Track Leaderboards:** Community-driven leaderboards (with appropriate privacy/sharing controls).
* **Enhanced Session Discovery:** Search for public sessions by track, car, etc.

**Monetization & Next Steps:**

My aim is to offer a generous free tier for core visualization, sharing, and discussion. I want everyone to be able to benefit is some way. For users needing more storage for many sessions or access to more advanced analysis features, there will likely be a subscription model to help sustain and grow the platform.

The immediate next step is to gather more feedback and then likely move towards a closed beta. If you're interested in being an early tester and helping shape Perfect Apex, please sign up here: [https://www.perfect-apex.com/](https://www.perfect-apex.com/)

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and for considering my evolved idea. Your honest opinions, critiques, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

**Key Changes and Why:**

1.  **Title:** More explicit about the update and pivot, while still inviting feedback.
2.  **Opening:** Stronger emphasis on *how* the previous feedback was used. This shows you genuinely listened. "Invaluable," "helped guide a shift."
3.  **"What's the New Vision?" Section:** Clearly articulates the core benefits of the new direction in a more engaging way before diving into features. Highlighting "various loggers" and "discussions *right on the data*" directly addresses some of the previous desires for hardware agnosticism and collaborative analysis.
4.  **Re-framing AI:** The explanation for "AI Chat" is crucial. You've downplayed the "magic AI race engineer" and reframed it as an analytical assistant for the *user*. This manages expectations and aligns better with what's likely feasible and useful given the data. It addresses the skepticism from the first post.
5.  **Clearer Ask with Demo:** "Please check out this live demo session" is a direct call to action. The bullet points for what kind of feedback you want are more specific.
6.  **"Help Me Prioritize!" for Future Ideas:** Makes the community feel more involved in the roadmap.
7.  **Monetization Framing:** "To help sustain and grow the platform" sounds better than just "charge for."
8.  **Stronger Call to Action Wording:** "Being an early tester and helping shape Perfect Apex" is more compelling.
9.  **Tone:** The language aims for genuine appreciation and a collaborative spirit. Phrases like "massive thank you," "incredibly insightful," "honest feedback," "thrilled if you could" contribute to this.
10. **Structure:** Using more distinct sections and bullet points makes it easier to read and digest.

This revised version aims to hit all your marks: humble (acknowledging past feedback led to change), genuine (sharing the journey), exciting (focusing on community and open data), and compelling (clear value proposition and call to action). Good luck with the post!
