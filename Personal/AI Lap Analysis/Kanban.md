- [ ] Import F1 data via https://tracinginsights.com/data/
- [ ] Feature: implement tracking of vehicle OBD data for visualisation
- [ ] Feature: AI chat/insights in compare
- [ ] Finish support for generic VBO. issue is they are non-standard.
	- RaceChrono VBO - [laptiming] (long, lat, flip long) - inline first point on start finish second point for orientation?
	- RaceBox VBO - [laptiming] (lat, long; flip long) - points make finish line
	- TrackAddict VBO, no [laptiming] but has lap column
- [ ] Feature: Video sync e.g. using https://www.mux.com/pricing/video
- [ ] Feature: 3rd party integration to popular lap timers
- [ ] Analyse specific corners?
	
	"And then when analyzing, if on the playback map, you could say, hey I want to look at this specific corner and then the map/data timeline would jump to the start of that corner and the data would also auto shift the x axis/time to sync up all the laps so you can see how each lap varies through that single corner."
	
	"The sectional analysis is what is useful, but I still look for my best lap time, though I'm not going to slow anyone else down to get it."
- [ ] The upload modal disappears if you click outside it and any entered data is removed.
- [ ] Upload multiple sessions at once
- [ ] Feat: User garage
- [ ] Social: Create discord?
- [ ] **Account for traffic or slow laps**
	
	"The most significant piece of feedback on the AI is that it doesn't seem to account for traffic or other external factors. One user pointed out that the AI flagged a massive speed difference in a corner that was clearly caused by traffic, not driver error."
	
	"One thing I would like to know, in hpde timing, is how many times in a lap I slowed down to let a faster driver by. Maybe throttle lifts in a straight would be an approximate measure."
