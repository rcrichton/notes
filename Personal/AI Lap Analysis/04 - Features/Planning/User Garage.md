Current planning for the vehicle management system.

## Core Features
*   **Vehicle Management**: Add, edit, and remove vehicles (Make, Model, Year).
*   **Photo Gallery**: Upload photos to showcase the build.
*   **Gear Tracking**: Definition of data logger hardware used (e.g., RaceChrono, VBOX, Dragy) to provide context on data accuracy.

## Modification Tracking
Crucial for understanding performance attribution over time.
*   **Mod History**: List of modifications (Suspension, Engine, Aero, Tires).
*   **Timestamp/Date**: **Critical**: Every modification must have an installed/removed date.
*   **Session Correlation**: The system will automatically link specific mods to sessions based on the session date, allowing users to answer "Was this lap set with the new coilovers?".

## Integration
*   **User Dashboard**: A summary of vehicles appears on the [[User Dashboard]].
*   **Session Upload**: Auto-select default vehicle if only one exists.
