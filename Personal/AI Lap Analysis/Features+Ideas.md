	- People and sessions?
- Session history stats
	- Distance lapped, laps completed, tracks raced
- AI Insights panel
	- populate first AI chat message
	- distill insight from that.

## Release 2

## Future
* Video integration
- First party integrations with popular lap timers
- Lap leader board
	- Good idea, but is only really useful when more data is uploaded
- Friend challenges
	- This might require capturing data live, how would it work for retrospective data
- Mode for car setup chat
- Activity feed ads?
