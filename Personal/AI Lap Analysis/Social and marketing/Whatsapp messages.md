Hi all, I wanted to share something I've been working hard on.

For those of you that capture lap times with apps like RaceChrono, TrackAddict, or a RaceBox, I've just opened up the open beta for my new platform, Perfect Apex. It lets you upload your data to visually compare your laps and see where you can improve.

You can see it in action with one of my recent sessions at Dezzi's here: https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/e909c3c5-0aa3-47b2-83f0-f7933500110f

I'd love for you to try uploading one of your own sessions. As a thank you to early testers, the AI analysis is free on all uploads for now. So far the response has been amazing, with around 100 sessions already uploaded from people all over the world.

If you find it useful, please feel free to share it with other racing groups you're on. If you are interested, you can get started at https://www.perfect-apex.com/.
