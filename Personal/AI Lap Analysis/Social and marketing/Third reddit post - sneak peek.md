title: A sneak peak at features coming to Perfect Apex, what are your thoughts?
---
Hi all,

Thanks for all the feedback I've received from you all so far on the development of Perfect Apex. I'm close to releasing this into the wild so i thought I'd give you a sneak peak into the latest features I've added.

There is now a lap event timeline showing the straights, braking zones and corners all with their own set of useful details. There is also AI processing of the fastest laps which are then presented as AI Insights (backed by a more in-depth report). Any and all feedback is welcome! I hope this will be useful tools to better understand lap data.

I'm planning on doing a beta release before the end of this month. If you are keen to try it out early, sign up to the [waitlist](https://www.perfect-apex.com/) and I'l send out a email when it's ready.
