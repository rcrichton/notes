**Title: It's Here! Perfect Apex Open Beta is LIVE - with Free AI Analysis for all!**

Hi everyone,

Wow, it's been quite a journey.

Many of you might remember my first post about an "AI Race Engineer." Your feedback was clear: the real need wasn't just another AI tool, but an open platform to bring our fragmented track day data together. You wanted to analyze, compare, and share laps with each other, regardless of what lap timer you use.

For the past several months, I've poured my passion for racing and coding into building that vision. Today, I'm incredibly excited to announce that **Perfect Apex is now in Open Beta and ready for you to try!**

**Launch Special: Free AI Analysis For Everyone!**

To celebrate the launch and to say thank you to this community, **I've enabled free, unlimited AI Analysis on all sessions for every user for a limited time.** Upload your data and see what insights the AI can find for you, completely on me.

**What can you do right now?**

*   **Bring Your Data Home:** Upload your sessions from the most popular lap timers (TrackAddict, RaceChrono, RaceBox, Lap Legend, and more to come).
*   **Harness the Power of AI:** Get instant, automated "AI Insights" on your driving to pinpoint where you can improve. (Free for all users for a limited time!)
*   **Compare Laps:** Visually overlay your laps to see where time is won and lost. (Free plan: compare against your own laps. Racer & Pro plans: unlock comparing with friends and other drivers).
*   **Discover and Learn:** Explore public sessions from other drivers on tracks around the world. See their lines, their data, and learn from the community.
*   **Share & Discuss:** Share any session with a simple link. Friends, coaches, and teammates can view your data and leave comments right on the timeline to give feedback.

**For the Community & Supporting the Project**

This project was born from community feedback, and I want to be a tool anyone can use. The free tier is designed to be powerful enough for the majority of track day enthusiasts.

This has been a massive undertaking and a true passion project built by just one person (me!). To help me continue developing and improving Perfect Apex, I'm offering two subscription plans: Racer and Pro As an extra thank you for the launch, all plans are 25% off! If you are interested.

Subscribing is the single best way to support me and the project, allowing me to dedicate more time to building the features we all want to see (Let me know if you have something you'd love to see!). You can see the full details here: [https://www.perfect-apex.com/pricing](https://www.perfect-apex.com/pricing)

I'm very happy to finally share this with the community that helped shape it. Please give it a go: upload a session from your last track day and see what the free AI Insights tell you about your driving. This is a beta, so if you encounter any bugs, have ideas, or just want to chat, please reach out here on Reddit or via email at perfectapex.info@gmail.com. All feedback is welcome!

Let's get faster, together.

**TL;DR:** The open, community-driven track data platform we talked about is now LIVE. For a limited time, AI Analysis is FREE for everyone and all subscriptions are 25% off. Upload your laps, get AI insights, and compare sessions with others. [https://www.perfect-apex.com/](https://www.perfect-apex.com/)

## Suggested First Comment

Hi all, thanks so much for checking out the post!

For anyone who wants to see Perfect Apex in action without signing up, here's a direct link to a shared session from one of my [recent track days](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1mgh5ki/had_a_wet_weather_track_day_recently_and_it_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

[https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/e909c3c5-0aa3-47b2-83f0-f7933500110f](https://www.perfect-apex.com/session/e909c3c5-0aa3-47b2-83f0-f7933500110f)

When you open it, you'll see all the laps from the session visualized all at once. You'll also see the AI Insights generated for the session right in the session analysis. What you don't get to see, however, is the full detailed AI analysis that only the session owner sees.

After you've had a look, I encourage you to upload one of your own sessions. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on the AI insights it generates for your driving!

I'll be hanging out here for a while to answer any questions if there are any.


# AI feedback on post comments
Of course, Iâ€™ve analyzed the Reddit post about your new product, "Perfect Apex." Here is an in-depth overview of the sentiments, a list of specific issues and feedback, and a set of recommended action items.

### Overview of Sentiments

The overall sentiment surrounding your product is overwhelmingly positive. Users are enthusiastic and impressed with "Perfect Apex," describing it as "awesome," "great," and "spectacular." The user interface is praised for being "very friendly," and the AI-powered analysis has been compared favorably to expensive hardware like the Garmin Catalyst. The community on /r/CarTrackDays seems very receptive and supportive of your project, with many users expressing that they have been looking for a tool just like this.

### Specific Issues and Feedback

Here is a list of specific points raised by the community:

- **Positive Feedback:**
    
    - The playback feature with overlaid laps is a big hit, effectively highlighting where time is gained or lost.
        
    - The AI feedback is considered accurate and similar to what you would get from a much more expensive device.
        
    - The app works well with data from various devices, including RaceBox, and even for motorcycle track days.
        
    - The free tier is seen as powerful enough for casual enthusiasts, which is a significant plus.
        
- **Bugs and Issues:**
    
    - The app doesn't remember the user's car and driver name, requiring them to be re-entered with each use.
        
    - A user reported that their preference for MPH in the settings is ignored, with the app displaying KPH instead.
        
- **Feature Requests and Suggestions:**
    
    - The most significant piece of feedback on the AI is that it doesn't seem to account for traffic or other external factors. One user pointed out that the AI flagged a massive speed difference in a corner that was clearly caused by traffic, not driver error.
        
    - A user expressed interest in a lifetime subscription option, indicating a willingness to invest in the product long-term.
        

### Action Items Going Forward

Based on the feedback, here are some recommended next steps:

- **Prioritize Bug Fixes:** Immediately address the issue with the MPH/KPH setting and implement a feature to remember user and car information. These are small quality-of-life improvements that will show your users that you are listening and responsive.
    
- **Enhance the AI:** This is the most critical area for improvement.
    
    - **Acknowledge the feedback:** Publicly thank the user who pointed out the AI's limitation regarding traffic and let the community know you are working on it.
        
    - **Develop a solution:** Consider adding a feature that allows users to flag laps affected by traffic or other issues. In the long term, you could explore ways for the AI to automatically detect and account for such anomalies.
        
- **Engage with Your Community:**
    
    - **Be present:** Continue to be active in the Reddit thread and other forums where your users are. Thank them for their feedback, answer their questions, and keep them updated on your progress.
        
    - **Consider a roadmap:** Share a public roadmap of planned features and improvements to keep the community engaged and excited about the future of "Perfect Apex."
        
- **Evaluate Your Pricing Strategy:** The request for a lifetime subscription is a strong buying signal. While you are currently offering a discount, consider if a lifetime option or other pricing tiers would be a good fit for your business model.
    

By addressing these points, you can build on the current wave of positive momentum, strengthen your relationship with your early adopters, and continue to develop "Perfect Apex" into an indispensable tool for the track day community.
