title: A new way to analyze and share your TrackAddict data on an open platform

Hi all,

I hope it's ok to post this here, but i think it's something that might be useful to this community.

I'm a developer and track day enthusiast and wanted to share a project I’ve been working on. My goal was to create a single, web-based platform where we can all bring our track day data together, no matter what lap timer or device we use.

The project is called Perfect Apex. A big part of making it useful is supporting the most popular timers, which is why I’m happy to let this community know that I've recently added support for RaceChrono.

This means you can now upload your RaceChrono files to Perfect Apex and get access to all the analysis tools. You can:

* Upload your RaceChrono sessions and store them alongside data from other popular timers.

* View advanced data visualizations like an events timeline showing braking and cornering, plus interactive charts, a GPS map, and speed traces.

* Visually compare your laps against yourself or each other to see exactly where you're gaining or losing time.

* Easily share and get feedback by sending a simple link to friends or coaches, who can comment directly on the session analysis.

I've also been experimenting with an "AI Insights" feature that tries to automatically find areas for improvement. It's still new, so I've set it up so that every new user can analyze their first two sessions completely for free. I would genuinely love to get feedback on whether the insights it provides are actually helpful for you.

My main goal here is to make something the community can use, with powerful core features that are free for everyone.

This is very much a work in progress, and the main reason I'm posting here is to get it in front of dedicated RaceChrono users. I'd be incredibly grateful if you could take a look, maybe upload an old session file, and let me know what you think. All feedback is welcome.

For anyone interested in following the project's progress, I've also just created a new Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/perfect_apex/

Thanks for reading!
