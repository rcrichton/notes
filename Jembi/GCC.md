# New direction discussion (08/04/2025)
- Dabat, Amhara region (political issues for Addis)
- Malaria/Climate
- Focus on collecting high quality data
	- Individual data therefore needed
	- Plus platform to collect it
- Focus on integrating with other partner already doing prediction
	- Ephidemia? - doing predictive analysis - https://ecograph.net/epidemia/
	- CHAP - involved in Ethiopia

# Critical milestones
From email attachment

> Grand Challenges Canada is a milestone-based organization whereby funds are distributed to innovators based on demonstrated project progress. GCC has standard reports and milestones that are required for all innovators. In addition, GCC asks innovators to identify key milestones that are critical to reach and that mark progress towards achievement of expected outcomes. When milestones are set, it is essential that they are achievable within the indicated timeframe and should ideally reflect key steps that have been recently completed.

> Agreed upon milestones will be included in a “Schedule of Milestones, Reports, and Payments”, which outlines the time points in which Progress, Results and Financial reports are due, and when payments can be expected once critical milestones have been met. 

> Please identify several Critical Milestones which would indicate progress towards demonstrating additional validation and successful scaling for your project.
> Note:  Please focus on key milestones rather than ongoing activities. Approximately 1-3 key milestones are expected for each reporting period; you do not need to include an exhaustive list of all activities. 


> Month 5: (Milestones to be completed by June 30, 2025)
> 1. Mid-term project progress report summary           
> 2. Initial review of current state of the art of  integrated climate change and public health surveillance and data.
> 3. Initial draft implementation research plan          
> 4. Initial climate and health data requirements analysis, technical solution architecture and report visualisations gathered from in country stakeholders
> 5. Initial prioritised climate and health data use cases uncovered from stakeholder workshops
> 6. Initial solution design and selection of standards used to implement the selected use case(s)
> 7. Pilot implementation plan and initial outcomes of pilot implementation 


>Month 9: (Milestones to be completed by October 31, 2025)
