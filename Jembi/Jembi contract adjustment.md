Hi Chris, Wayne,

I know things are very busy in light of everything going on, If you have the time to look through this, I have a proposal for changing my work hours that also might help Jembi in a small way. If you don't have time to look at this yet I understand.

As we are going through the process of cutting any extra spending at Jembi, I'd like to offer to adjust my work hours from next month. This would serve both of our needs as Jembi needs to cut costs and I'd like to move to this new working arrangement anyways.

I've created a proposal that I think would work. Please have a look through this and let me know your thoughts.

# Overview/suggested conditions
- Step down from role of Head of Engineering
- Step into a part-time Principle Software Engineer role as an Individual Contributor (i.e. not managing anyone)
- Work 10 hours per week which are flexible on weekday and time of day for those hours
- Retain my current day rate as calculated from my full time salary
- Remove conflict of interest/moonlighting clause, allow freedom to work on any external projects
- One month notice period in case this adjustment doesn't work out
- To protect myself with the current USG funding issue: agreement that severance (should it arise) be based off my full time rate since severance is based on years of service and I've been full time for the past 15 years.
